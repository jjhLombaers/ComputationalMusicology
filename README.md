# Computational Musicology Corpus: Afrobeat and American Funk.

My corpus contains around 70 tracks from the Afrobeat genre, and around 80 songs from the Funk genre. I chose these genres because I am a big fan of Afrobeat. Afrobeat is a musical genre from Nigeria that combines elements from West-African music with American jazz, funk and soul. In the 60s, Fela Kuti and his drummer Tony Allen pioneered the genre of Afrobeat. In this, Fela Kuti is said to have been influenced by American Funk musicians such as James Brown. I think it would be interesting to investigate differences between audio features of the two genres.

## Natural groups and comparison points
The natural groups in my corpus will mostly center around the tracks' genre. I expect there to be very little artists with tracks in both genres. I also expect the afrobeat songs to have a longer duration than the songs which belong to the funk genre. Moreover, I expect the distribution of artists over songs to be much more diverse for Funk than Afrobeat. I am mostly interested in determining the similarities and differences between audio features of the two genres.

Typical and atypical tracks:
| Song | Description | 
| ---- | ----------- |
| [Water No Get Enemy by Fela Kuti](https://open.spotify.com/track/4fGbjbqR2psf6zgwwBPecd?si=1112f233adaa4a32) | Reasons why this is a typical afrobeat song include its use of a large horn- and percussion sections, distinctive approach to rhythm, danceability, the political messaging of the lyrics and lengthy duration |
| [Fantastic Man](https://open.spotify.com/track/6lhyua0TZx9riFHAfliJlc?si=9c65e2361d22416a) | This is a slightly atypical song in that it involves slow "four-on-the-floor" kind of backbeat and does not make use of additional percussion or brass instruments |
| (Cold Sweat by James Brown)[https://open.spotify.com/track/3GWM2gYAWWBrrh1h9F8DEc?si=c9f378bf74514174] | This is a typical funk song in that it is energetic, the drums and bass are tightly locked, a `back beat' is played and the track is under 5 minutes |
