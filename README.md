# Computational Musicology Corpus: Differences between Afrobeat and Funk music.

Afrobeat is a musical genre from Nigeria that combines elements from West-African music with American jazz, funk and soul. Together with drummer Tony Allen, Fela Kuti has pioneered the genre of Afrobeat, in which he is said to have also been influenced by American Funk musicians such as James Brown. The musical genres make use of a largely similar set of instruments which can be seen through the composition of their rhythm sections and their use of large horn sections. I therefore want to investigate the differences and similarities between these two genres.

Typical and atypical tracks:
